## General info

In this course i learned all the things that we have in consider before having an interview even if we are in the process of talent selection, how to behave in some questions, tricky questions, or questions that the HR try to answer in a negative form, and how to handle all the nervous and body language to better expression of yourself. Remind that you sell yourself in the job interview and nobody will know you better than you in that. Prepare for technical interviews and try to be the most possitive and clear person in the interviews, never lie and answer with honesty, always ask the questions that you have in the job, and make it all clear for both the interviewer and interviewee.
